# Open Research

Here I will collect some of my general Open Research resources. For now, there is only the "puzzle illustration" I always use to explain what Open Research is about. First an [English](https://github.com/alexarje/open-research/tree/main/puzzle-illustration/English) version:

## Source files

The illustrations were made in LibreOffice Impress. Original .odp files are available in the [source folders](https://github.com/alexarje/open-research/tree/main/puzzle-illustration). There are also Powerpoint (.pptx) versions and exports to .pdf and .png.
